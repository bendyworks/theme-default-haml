This extension needs to match your version of spree.

Prep:
  git clone git://github.com/railsdog/spree.git
  cd spree

Approach #1: (throw away all spree changes newer than this gem)
  git reset --hard 186224d11c53d4dfd47b96a142ed79d1da8a2345

Approach #2: (bring this gem up to date with current spree)
  # see .erb changes that need to be replicated here in haml
  git diff 186224d11c53d4dfd47b96a142ed79d1da8a2345

  fork this gem
  # implement haml version of changes shown in git diff output above
  send a pull request for the work you did to be picked up here

Continue:
  cd spree
  # create your database.yml (copy database.yml.example?)
  rake db:create:all
  sudo rake gems:install
  sudo gem install jeweler
  rake db:migrate
  rake build
  sudo gem uninstall spree -v 0.9.99
  sudo gem install pkg/spree-0.9.99.gem
  [create spree project from gem with 'spree' command]
  [navigate to project root]
  [follow spree new project instructions, such as rake db:bootstrap]
  script/extension install git://github.com/bendyworks/spree-theme-default-hamlized


Notes:
-----
Keeping this up to date with spree changes at git://github.com/railsdog/spree is not going to happen in real-time.  Instead, this project will pull in a batch of changes at once.
We have currently accounted for all .erb files and file changes through commit 186224d11c53d4dfd47b96a142ed79d1da8a2345 at git://github.com/railsdog/spree.

If you account for newer .erb changes, then please update this comment and send a pull request.
